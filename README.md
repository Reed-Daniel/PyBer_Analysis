## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze PyBer ridesharing data from January-April 2019, calculate key metrics for the different city types they operate in, and provide compelling data visualizations for the CEO, V. Isualize. With our analysis, PyBer will be able to make educated decisions on how to improve access to their ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
Through our aggregation and analysis of PyBer's ride sharing data, we were able to calculate key metrics for the three city types (Rural, Suburban, Urban) that the company operates in.

After reviewing the summary statistics, we can determine the following:
 - Rural areas have
    - The **smallest collection of drivers** 
    - The **least total rides**
    - The **highest avg fare($) per ride**
 - Urban areas have
    - The **largest collection of drivers** 
    - The **most total rides**
    - The **lowest avg fare($) per ride**
 - Urban areas bring in the most revenue for PyBer
 - Rural area drivers earn the most $ per ride

The below visualization further corroborates our findings. Over the course of January 2019 - April 2019, PyBer maintained relatively steady revenue across the three city types they operate in with minor spikes between late February - mid March. PyBer's performance in each area was also proportional to the supply of drivers and the demand of rides (i.e. Urban areas had the highest demand for rides and the most drivers to fill those requests so subsequently they pulled in the most revenue week to week).

## Analysis Summary
From our analysis and depending on PyBer's goals for the future of their service, we can recommend the following adjustments to improve their business.
  - **Reduce hiring efforts for drivers in Urban areas**
    - Our data showed us that Urban drivers earned the least per ride as there were more drivers than requested rides thus leaving some drivers without a ride to carryout
    - As long as wait times aren't affected, aligning the number of drivers more closely to the demand for rides would allow PyBer's Urban employees to earn more per transaction and could reduce employee turnover
  - **Increase marketing efforts for Pyber users in Urban Areas**
    - Our data clearly showed that Urban areas are PyBer's highest performers in terms of revenue.
    - An increase in marketing efforts for PyBer's service would see an increase in users using their application thus creating more ride opportunities for the vast quantity of drivers in those areas to pick up
  - **Cap the fare amount for Rural areas**
    - Our data showed us that Rural riders were paying the most per transaction most likely due to the extended distances traveled per ride
    - A cap on the fare amount for Rural areas so that it is more aligned with its higher density counterparts could make the service more affordable and potentialy see an increase in demand for rides
    - An increase in demand would also require a subsequent increase in supply for drivers in the area to maintain quality service
